        <p> I like reading books , Its my favourite hobby. I read books in free time. My favourite books are - Dork diaries, The diary of a wimpy kid , Matilda and most importantly my most favourite Malory towers. The first novel i ever read was "Thea stilton-Treasure of the sea". I read this book in baharain with my aunt , We went to a book cafe , there u buy or borrow a book and gets some snacks or drinks to read it with.I also have a instagram page which does book reviews , tells facts , short stories and more (Name-The_adventures_in_bokland). I also want to say that "Books open the door for your imagination".
